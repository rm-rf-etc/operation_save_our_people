This will be a NodeJS React app, using something like NextJS or Gatsby or Astro or Ghost,
I haven't decided yet but I will have something here soon.

For the backend I'm eyeing MongoDB because I don't think we need any relational data, but
if I conclude differently after further planning, I'll update this doc.
