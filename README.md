# Operation Save Our People

This is a response to Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA), which is
projected to cause 51,000 (totally preventable) deaths per year.


## The Plan

We'll consolidate a list of known American billionaires and millionaires, estimate their
tax liability and the sum of their tax rewards as a result of the OBBBA, and express
that figure in term of lives lost.

This will give visibility to the pain and suffering caused by the super wealthy.

Anyone who wants to be removed from this list can contact us and donate their tax
rewards to a fund which will then be given back to the people who are losing their
healthcare as a consequence of Donald Trump's OBBBA.
