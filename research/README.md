Below is a practical blueprint for building a U.S.-billionaire database and a small worked example you can extend.  In short: start with a master list from Forbes or Bloomberg, enrich it with publicly reported compensation, dividends and (where available) leaked IRS figures, and store both the raw inputs and the logic you use to turn those inputs into a “taxable-income” estimate so the methodology stays transparent.

## 1.  Getting a Clean List of U.S. Billionaires

| Source                                            | Coverage                                                                                                       | Export options                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Forbes Real-Time Billionaires & Forbes 400**    | Forbes counted **902 U.S. billionaires in 2025**, the largest share in the world ([investopedia.com][1])       | HTML pages (parse with BeautifulSoup) or occasional CSV releases on Forbes’ GitHub |
| **Bloomberg Billionaires Index**                  | Dynamic top-500 ranking with daily net-worth updates; filter by “country = United States” ([bloomberg.com][2]) | JSON behind the web app (undocumented)                                             |
| **SEC Forms DEF 14A & 10-K**                      | Executive cash/stock compensation for public-company founders                                                  | Free EDGAR API                                                                     |
| **ProPublica “Secret IRS Files” series**          | 200-plus billionaires’ true AGI & tax paid (2006-2018 snapshot) ([propublica.org][3], [propublica.org][4])     | PDFs & CSV summary sheet                                                           |
| **Company dividend reports / Schedule K-1 leaks** | Dividends and partnership income for investors like Warren Buffett ([nasdaq.com][5])                           | Company IR pages, SEC exhibits                                                     |

> **Practical tip:**  begin by scraping Forbes’ 2025 list (the site uses one static HTML table per page) and load the fields *rank*, *name*, *net worth (USD)*, *age*, *primary company*, *residence* into a PostgreSQL table called `billionaires_us`.

## 2.  Why “Annual Income” Is Tricky—and How to Approximate It

1. **Most wealth is unrealised**.  For example, Jeff Bezos’ fortune grew \$127 billion from 2006-18, yet he reported only \$6.5 billion of taxable income in that span (≈ \$500 million / yr) ([propublica.org][3]).
2. **Public pay packages** tell only part of the story.  Elon Musk’s landmark 2018 Tesla option grant was valued at **\$44.9 billion** when approved, but it vests over time and becomes taxable only at exercise ([pbs.org][6]).
3. **Dividend streams** are more straightforward.  Berkshire Hathaway alone is on track to receive **\$5.26 billion in cash dividends in 2025**, essentially Warren Buffett’s share of taxable income if he doesn’t sell stock ([nasdaq.com][5]).

### A workable proxy

For each person and each calendar year:

```
Estimated Taxable Income =
    Cash Salary/Bonus (SEC)
  + Vested Stock & Options Exercised (SEC notes)
  + Dividends/Partnership Distributions
  + Net Realised Capital Gains*
```

\*If realised gains are unknown, approximate with
`max(0 , Δ Net Worth – Unrealised Gains Rate%)`, using a long-run unrealised-gain ratio from ProPublica’s dataset.

IRS tables show the **top 0.001 %** already face an average effective rate near 24 % on reported AGI ([irs.gov][7], [irs.gov][8]), so once you impute AGI you can multiply by that or by statutory brackets (37 % wage, 20 % LTCG, 3.8 % NIIT) to produce a federal-tax estimate.

## 3.  Sample Mini-Table (Top 10 U.S. Billionaires, July 2 2025)

| Rank | Name                | Net Worth (\$B)          | Indicative 2024 Income Proxy (\$B)                   | Notes                       |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | **Elon Musk**       | 351 ([bloomberg.com][2]) | 45 (Tesla option tranche vested 2024) ([pbs.org][6]) | Mostly equity compensation  |
| 2    | **Larry Ellison**   | 179 ([forbes.com][9])    | 0.80 (cash & options)                                | Oracle proxy                |

| 4    | **Jeff Bezos**      | 160 ([forbes.com][9])    | 0.60 (avg. realised gains) ([propublica.org][3])     |                             |
| 5    | **Warren Buffett**  | 134 ([bloomberg.com][2]) | 5.26 (dividends) ([nasdaq.com][5])                   | Pays himself \$100 k salary |

| 9    | **Michael Dell**    | 113                      | 0.50 (Dell dividends + sales)                        |                             |
| 10   | **Steve Ballmer**   | 108                      | 1.90 (Microsoft dividends; 4 % yield)                |                             |

*Income proxies are rounded, illustrative, and should be recalculated once you ingest the latest SEC filings and dividend declarations.*

## 4.  Building the Database Step-by-Step

### 4.1  Ingest billionaire roster

```python
import pandas as pd, requests, bs4, sqlalchemy as sa
url = "https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/"
soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(requests.get(url).text, "html.parser")
rows = [{...parse each <tr>…} for tr in soup.select("table tbody tr")]
df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
engine = sa.create_engine("postgresql://…")
df.to_sql("billionaires_us", engine, if_exists="replace", index=False)
```

### 4.2  Append compensation & dividend feeds

| Table       | Key fields                                  | Refresh cadence  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `exec_comp` | cik, name, year, salary, bonus, stock\_vest | Annual (DEF 14A) |
| `dividends` | ticker, ex-date, amount, shares\_owned      | Quarterly        |
| `irs_leaks` | name, year, agi\_reported                   | Static (2006-18) |

Use `LEFT JOIN` on `name` (standardised) or better, add a `person_id` you maintain manually.

### 4.3  Generate taxable-income view

```sql
CREATE VIEW v_income_est AS
SELECT b.person_id,
       year,
       COALESCE(exec.salary,0)+COALESCE(exec.bonus,0)
     + COALESCE(exec.stock_vest,0)
     + COALESCE(div.total_dividend,0)
     + COALESCE(irs.cap_gains_est,0) AS est_income
FROM billionaires_us b
LEFT JOIN exec_comp exec USING(person_id, year)
LEFT JOIN dividends div USING(person_id, year)
LEFT JOIN irs_leaks irs USING(person_id, year);
```

Add a second view `v_est_tax` that multiplies `est_income` by your chosen effective-rate logic.

## 5.  Caveats & Next Steps

* **Privacy & legality** – scraped web data is public; leaked IRS files, while newsworthy, raise ethical questions. Document provenance carefully.
* **Coverage gaps** – private-company owners (e.g., Koch, Hagedorn families) rarely disclose dividends or sales.  You may need to estimate realised gains using year-to-year Forbes net-worth deltas (be explicit about the assumption).
* **Millionaires phase** – once the pipeline works for \~900 billionaires, widen the net by merging IRS SOI percentile tables with Survey of Consumer Finances microdata to model the \~22 million U.S. dollar millionaires.

When you’re ready, I can walk you through automating each ingestion step or refining the tax-rate model.
